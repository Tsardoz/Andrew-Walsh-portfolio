# Costek: Power Station Simulator Systems Engineering

## Position Overview
As Senior Systems Engineer at Costek, I designed and implemented the hardware and system architecture for power station simulators used in operator training. These simulators replicated actual power station control panels with high fidelity, allowing for realistic training scenarios and fault condition simulations.

## Technical Contributions

### Hardware Design and Implementation
- Designed comprehensive interface boards that handled multiple I/O types:
  - Analog inputs for sensor simulation
  - Analog outputs for gauge and instrument control
  - Digital inputs for switch and button states
  - Digital outputs for indicator lights and alarms
- Created multi-board systems that accurately replicated power station control interfaces
- Implemented robust communication protocols between interface components

### Microcontroller Development
- Programmed 8051-type microcontrollers for real-time control systems
- Developed firmware using C and PLM51 programming languages
- Created systems for accurate timing and synchronization across multiple controllers
- Implemented fault-tolerant communication methods

### System Architecture
- Designed serial bus communication systems connecting interface boards to rack-mounted computers
- Created hardware architectures that could scale to match different power station configurations
- Developed systems for realistic simulation of response times and behaviors
- Established protocols for fault simulation and emergency procedure training

### Integration with Simulation Models
- Created hardware interfaces compatible with mathematical simulation models
- Implemented I/O systems that translated between software models and physical interfaces
- Developed calibration systems to ensure accurate representation of model outputs
- Built diagnostic tools for system validation and troubleshooting

## Technical Skills Applied
- Electronic hardware design
- Microcontroller programming (8051 architecture)
- Firmware development (C, PLM51)
- Serial communication protocols
- System architecture design
- Real-time control systems
- I/O interface design

## Impact
These power station simulators enabled comprehensive operator training without risk to actual power infrastructure. By creating high-fidelity hardware interfaces that behaved identically to real control systems, operators could develop and maintain skills for handling both routine operations and emergency scenarios in a safe, controlled environment.
