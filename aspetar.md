# Aspetar: Data Science in Sports Medicine

## Position Overview
As a Data Scientist at Aspetar, a FIFA-accredited sports medicine hospital in Doha, Qatar, I applied advanced data analysis and engineering skills to a diverse range of projects spanning occupational health, sports performance, and physiological monitoring. Working with an international team of experts, I developed innovative approaches to complex problems in extreme environments.

## Key Projects

### Occupational Health Investigation in Extreme Heat
- **Challenge:** Investigate unexplained deaths among welders working in Qatar's extreme heat conditions (up to 50Â°C)
- **Approach:** Analyzed comprehensive physiological data from workers including core temperature (via ingestible temperature sensors), hydration levels, and environmental conditions
- **Technical Implementation:** Designed data collection protocols and developed analysis methodologies for diverse physiological metrics
- **Findings:** While conclusive causes weren't established during the study period, formulated a hypothesis about microshocks from welding equipment potentially causing cardiovascular damage, possibly exacerbated by other factors
- **Impact:** This investigation later influenced my decision to pursue medical education to better understand physiological mechanisms

### Core Temperature Prediction Modeling
- **Technical Challenge:** Develop non-invasive methods to predict core body temperature
- **Engineering Approach:** Applied transfer function theory from electronic engineering to create mathematical models
- **Implementation:** Developed algorithms relating surface temperature measurements to core temperature
- **Validation:** Used data from ingestible temperature sensors to validate prediction models
- **Application:** Created tools for monitoring athletes training in extreme heat conditions

### Computer Vision for Player Tracking
- **Innovation:** Developed early-stage computer vision systems for tracking football players during matches
- **Technical Implementation:** Used OpenCV and Python to build object detection and tracking algorithms
- **Methodology:** Created systems to identify players based primarily on uniform colors and movement patterns
- **Context:** This work was conducted during the infancy of sports tracking technology, predating current sophisticated systems
- **Achievement:** Successfully demonstrated viable player tracking capabilities, establishing proof-of-concept for further development

### Athletic Performance Psychology Analysis
- **Research Question:** Investigate correlations between psychological attributes and athletic performance
- **Data Analysis:** Conducted statistical analysis of psychological survey responses from Australian football players
- **Findings:** Identified significant correlations between certain psychological attributes and performance levels
- **Notable Observation:** Discovered potential patterns in psychological attributes among indigenous athletes that correlated with successful performance
- **Methodology:** Applied advanced statistical techniques to identify patterns in complex psychological data

## Technical Skills Applied
- Computer vision development (OpenCV, Python)
- Statistical analysis of psychological and physiological data
- Mathematical modeling of physiological systems
- Transfer function theory application to biological systems (Matlab)
- Experimental design for data collection in extreme environments

## Impact and Legacy
The diverse projects at Aspetar demonstrated the value of applying data science across disciplines - from occupational health to sports performance. This position required adapting technical approaches to complex real-world problems in a unique environment, developing solutions that bridged engineering principles, data analysis, and human physiology understanding.
