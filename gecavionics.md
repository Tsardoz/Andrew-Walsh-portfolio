# GEC Avionics: Early Career Aerospace Engineering

## Position Overview
As a Development Engineer at GEC Avionics in Kent, United Kingdom, I was one of only two graduates selected from across Australia during their international recruitment drive. This prestigious first position gave me a significant advantage by placing me directly into a design role immediately after graduation, which was uncommon for Australian engineering graduates at the time.

## Technical Projects

### Resonant Frequency Fuel Measurement System
- **Concept**: Developed a sensor system that measured fuel levels by analyzing the resonant frequency of a rod placed inside aircraft fuel tanks
- **Technical Implementation**: Designed both hardware and firmware components for the measurement system
- **Engineering Challenge**: Determined that while the principle was sound in controlled environments, the application was impractical for helicopter implementation due to interference from aircraft vibrations
- **Outcome**: Provided critical evaluation of the technology's limitations in real-world aerospace applications, saving further development costs

### Microwave-Based Tire Temperature Sensor
- **Concept**: Analyzed a system using microwave blackbody radiation to measure the internal temperature of aircraft tires
- **Technical Approach**: Performed mathematical modeling to correlate microwave readings with internal tire temperatures
- **Technical Advantage**: The system aimed to penetrate the tire material to obtain average internal temperature readings regardless of surface conditions
- **Engineering Analysis**: Determined that despite the theoretical advantages, practical implementation was hindered by surface condition effects (rain, external temperature)
- **Assessment**: Concluded that while the concept had merit, the technology available at the time was insufficient to achieve the required accuracy (noted that modern AI methods might potentially overcome these limitations)

## Technical Skills Applied
- Hardware design for aerospace applications
- Firmware development for sensor systems
- Mathematical modeling of physical phenomena
- Engineering feasibility analysis
- Practical evaluation of theoretical concepts

## Career Foundation
This position at GEC Avionics provided essential early career experience in designing and evaluating complex engineering systems. The ability to critically analyze the practical limitations of theoretical approaches established a foundation for my later work across various technical domains. Though neither project proceeded to production, both experiences demonstrated the importance of thorough practical evaluation of innovative concepts before full-scale implementation.
