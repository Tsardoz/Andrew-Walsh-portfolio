# Sifter Labs: Revolutionizing Hydroponic Nutrient Management

## Overview
SaltSifter is an innovative platform that optimizes nutrient solutions for hydroponic cultivation, providing precisely calibrated formulations at 90% cost reduction compared to commercial products.

## The Problem
Commercial hydroponic nutrients are:
- Extremely overpriced (often 10x the cost of raw materials)
- Generic rather than plant-specific
- Not optimized for different growth stages
- Supported by outdated software with poor user interfaces (e.g., Hydrobuddy, Nutron 2000)

## The Solution
SaltSifter provides:

### Advanced Nutrient Optimization
- Mathematical multi-objective optimization engine that calculates precise combinations of raw salts
- Plant-specific formulations calibrated to exact growth stages
- Optimises critical nutrient ratios not just raw amounts
- 90% cost reduction compared to pre-mixed commercial solutions

### Intelligent Plant Health Diagnostics
- Computer vision system that analyzes plant health issues
- Correlates visual symptoms with nutrient data for accurate diagnosis
- Moves beyond simplistic symptom identification to root cause analysis

### AI-Powered Expertise
- Specialized AI assistant trained on comprehensive hydroponic knowledge
- Voice interface for natural interaction with the system
- Continuous learning from user outcomes to improve recommendations

### Technical Implementation
- Full-stack web application (TypeScript/Python/Node.js)
- Device-agnostic design accessible from any internet-connected device
- Developed using AI-assisted programming (Claude Code, Kilo Code)

## Market Differentiation
Unlike existing solutions (Hydrobuddy, Nutron 2000), SaltSifter is the first platform to integrate:
- Plant-specific nutrient optimization
- Growth stage calibration
- Visual diagnostics
- AI-powered expertise
- Modern user interface

## Development Status
Currently building the core optimization engine and web interface, with plans to integrate computer vision diagnostics and specialized AI assistance in future iterations.
