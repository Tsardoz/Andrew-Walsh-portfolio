Epstein Files: Public Document Search and Analysis Platform
Project Overview
I am developing a comprehensive web application to make the released Epstein court documents accessible and searchable for public interest researchers, journalists, and concerned citizens. The Department of Justice released thousands of pages of documents, but in an intentionally obfuscated format - scattered JPEG and TIFF image files with no OCR, making them essentially unusable for research. My platform will transform this jumbled archive into a fully searchable, organized database with AI-powered document retrieval.
Technical Achievements (In Development)
Document Processing Pipeline (Completed)

Implemented advanced OCR techniques to extract text from 35,000 image files (JPEG/TIFF format)
Developed intelligent document grouping algorithms to reconstruct original documents from scattered pages
Created automated page ordering and document reconstruction systems
Built metadata extraction to identify subjects, dates, and document relationships
Generated Florence-based AI summaries of all documents

AI-Powered Search System (In Development)

Designing a RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) system for intelligent document search
Implementing LangChain integration for contextual query understanding
Building natural language processing to handle complex research queries
Creating document summarization while maintaining links to original source images

User Interface and Experience (Planned)

Developing a Google-like search interface for intuitive document discovery
Building comprehensive results display showing AI summaries alongside source documents
Implementing direct linking to original document images
Creating a professional, responsive web interface using TypeScript, Node.js, and Express

Technical Implementation

Full-stack application being built with Node.js, TypeScript, and Express
Serverless architecture using RunPod for automatic scaling and cost efficiency
PostgreSQL database storing extracted text with links to original images
Cloud storage (S3/R2) for serving original document images via CDN
Advanced OCR and computer vision techniques (proprietary implementation)
RAG architecture with LangChain for intelligent retrieval
Integration with donation platform (Buy Me a Coffee) for sustainability

Architecture Design

Serverless-first approach: Using RunPod's 250ms cold start for instant scalability
Stateless API: Each search request is independent, perfect for serverless
CDN-delivered images: 35,000 processed JPEGs served directly from cloud storage
Database-driven search: Full-text search on pre-processed OCR content
No runtime processing: All heavy OCR computation completed in advance

Current Status

Completed:

OCR processing of all 35,000 documents
Florence-based AI summarization
Database schema design with extracted text and image references


In Progress:

Express/TypeScript API development
Search interface implementation


Upcoming:

LangChain integration
RunPod serverless deployment
Public launch and outreach



Future Scalability
While the current release of Epstein-related documents is allegedly limited in scope, there is increasing public demand for the full release of all files. The architecture I'm developing is designed to scale - when additional documents are released, the same processing pipeline and search infrastructure will seamlessly handle the expanded dataset. This positions the platform to become the primary public resource for accessing and researching these materials as they become available.
Deployment Strategy

Soft launch: Initial release to technical communities (Hacker News, r/DataHoarder) for feedback
Infrastructure testing: Ensure system handles viral traffic spikes ("Reddit hug of death")
Media outreach: Coordinate with investigative journalists and transparency advocates
Sustained operations: Donation-based model to maintain free public access

Planned Impact

Transform inaccessible government document dumps into searchable public resource
Enable journalists, researchers, and citizens to investigate important public interest materials
Provide free access to ensure information remains available regardless of economic means
Create transparency tool for documents of significant international interest
Ready to scale for future document releases as public pressure mounts for full disclosure

Technical Skills Applied

Computer vision and OCR technologies
Natural language processing and RAG systems
Full-stack web development (Node.js, TypeScript, Express)
Serverless architecture and auto-scaling systems
Database design for large-scale text search
Cloud infrastructure and CDN optimization
Document processing and reconstruction algorithms
AI integration (LangChain, Florence)

This project represents my commitment to using technology for public transparency and accountability. By making these documents genuinely accessible, the platform will serve the public interest while demonstrating advanced document processing and AI integration capabilities. The system is designed to be self-sustaining through voluntary donations, ensuring continued public access to these important materials.
