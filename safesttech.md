# Safest Tech: Innovative Fall Detection System

## Project Overview
As Chief Scientist at Safest Tech, I developed a revolutionary approach to elderly fall detection that dramatically reduced hardware costs while increasing detection accuracy. This project evolved from my experience at HomeGuardian, addressing the key limitations I had identified in edge-only processing systems.

## Innovation Highlights

### Cost Reduction Strategy
- Reduced hardware costs from approximately $200 to $20 per installation
- Replaced expensive SBC systems with modified commercial IP cameras
- Developed custom firmware modifications for off-the-shelf cameras
- Created a solution that could be deployed at scale due to significantly lower hardware costs

### Hybrid Edge-Cloud Architecture
- Designed a two-stage detection system that optimized resource usage
- Edge component: Modified camera firmware to detect motion cessation (potential fall indicator)
- Cloud component: When motion stopped, the system captured and sent images to cloud-based analysis
- Leveraged advanced Vision Language Models (VLMs) in the cloud for accurate fall classification

### Technical Implementation
- Reverse-engineered commercial camera firmware to enable custom detection capabilities
- Implemented efficient motion detection algorithms on resource-constrained camera hardware
- Developed secure communication protocols for sending images to cloud processing
- Created a backend system using advanced Vision Language Models for precise fall analysis
- Designed the system to maintain privacy while still enabling accurate detection

## Results
- Achieved significantly higher detection accuracy than previous edge-only solutions
- Created a commercially viable product with dramatically lower hardware costs
- Developed a scalable architecture that could be easily deployed across multiple locations
- Established a technical foundation capable of ongoing improvements through cloud model updates
