# U@MQ: Innovative Research Projects

## Position Overview
As Research Manager at U@MQ (a commercial entity affiliated with but separate from Macquarie University), I developed innovative research concepts and facilitated collaboration between my technical expertise and academic researchers. Though administrative constraints limited direct grant applications, I successfully initiated projects that secured funding through academic partnerships.

## Key Research Initiatives

### Retinal Vessel Analysis for Medical Diagnostics
- **Concept Development:** Extended my PhD work on cardiovascular systems to analyze retinal blood vessel pulsations using computer vision
- **Technical Implementation:** Developed Matlab-based image processing algorithms to detect and measure subtle changes in retinal vessel diameter in real time
- **Clinical Applications:** Aimed to correlate vessel pulsation patterns with blood pressure and other cardiovascular conditions
- **Outcome:** Successfully secured research funding through the School of Advanced Medicine at Macquarie University
- **Innovation:** Moved beyond traditional static retinal imaging to dynamic, quantitative pulsation analysis

### Music-Synchronized Exercise Performance Enhancement
- **Concept Development:** Proposed using rhythmically-timed music to improve athletic performance, particularly for runners
- **Research Hypothesis:** Suggested dual mechanisms of action - physiological synchronization of movement with music beats, and psychological/emotional performance enhancement
- **Collaboration:** Partnered with researchers in the School of Psychology to develop the research methodology
- **Outcome:** Completed research proposal and grant application before end of contract

### Infrared Swimmer Tracking System
- **Technical Challenge:** Develop a system to track swimmers' positions continuously rather than just at lap completion
- **System Design:** Created an infrared laser scanning system with reflective swim caps for real-time position detection
- **Hardware Development:** Designed electronic components and control systems using engineering background
- **Technical Implementation:** Developed initial prototypes and analysis software in Matlab
- **Innovation:** Represented a shift from discrete lap timing to continuous position tracking for performance analysis

## Technical Skills Applied
- Computer vision and image processing (Matlab)
- Statistical analysis (R, Matlab)
- Electronic system design for sports applications
- Research concept development and grant proposal writing
- Interdisciplinary collaboration between engineering, medicine, and psychology

## Impact
Despite organizational constraints that limited my ability to directly apply for funding, I successfully:
- Initiated a funded medical imaging project that extended my PhD research
- Developed cross-disciplinary research concepts that bridged technology and human performance
- Designed innovative technical solutions for sports performance analysis
- Demonstrated ability to translate technical expertise into viable research proposals
