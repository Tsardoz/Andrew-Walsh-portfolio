# Brisbane Lions: Advanced Sports Analytics System

## Project Overview
As Analytics Manager for the Brisbane Lions AFL team, I developed a comprehensive player evaluation and team performance system that transformed the club's approach to recruitment, game strategy, and player development. My work helped the club transition from a consistent bottom-place finisher to a top team.

## Technical Achievements

### Player Contribution Modeling
- Developed sophisticated mathematical regression models that quantified each player's contribution relative to the average player at their position
- Created position-specific performance metrics aligned with actual on-field responsibilities (defense, midfield, forward)
- Designed metrics to measure impact in points contributed to game outcome rather than raw statistics
- Used scikit-learn and Python to implement complex statistical models

### Comprehensive Recruitment Analysis
- Created a system to analyze every player in the AFL and state leagues each weekend
- Developed performance benchmarks for each position to identify undervalued talent
- Built tools to support recruiters by highlighting promising players they might otherwise miss
- Generated automated reports ranking available players by projected value

### Real-Time Performance Analytics
- Implemented live in-game analytics showing player and team performance metrics
- Delivered actionable insights to coaching staff during games to inform tactical decisions
- Tracked performance trends throughout games to identify patterns and opportunities
- Provided objective data to supplement coaches' subjective observations

### Technical Implementation
- Developed a full-stack web application using Python, PostgreSQL, and JavaScript
- Created interactive visualizations of complex player performance metrics (Plotly)
- Built database systems to store and analyze years of player and team data
- Implemented secure, role-based access to analytics throughout the organization

## Impact
- Developed analytics systems during a period when the club rose from consistently finishing last to reaching second (out of 18 teams) within 3 years
- Created player recruitment analytics tools available to decision-makers
- Built objective metrics for evaluating player performance across the league
- Designed systems capable of analyzing every player in the competition rather than just those directly observed

## Technical Skills Applied
- Statistical modeling and regression analysis
- Full-stack web development
- Database design and implementation
- Data visualization
- Sports-specific data analytics

The Brisbane Lions position represented the culmination of years of developing sports analytics methodologies, allowing me to implement a comprehensive system at scale with full organizational support. The mathematical modeling techniques I developed pre-dated the current AI-focused approaches but established foundational metrics that continue to inform sports analytics today.
